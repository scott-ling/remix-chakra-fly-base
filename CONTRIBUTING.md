nice and simple

1. check Issues, to see if your contribution is has been suggested or not
2. add issue relating to contribution to Issues (if it does not exist)
3. repo owner will flag contribution idea as approved or not (almost all will be approved)
4. create pull request when contribution is ready
5. pending a check, contribution will be merged and contributor will be added to contributors list, and thanks documentation.

all of the above is open to discussion, just raise changes to process as an issue ;)
